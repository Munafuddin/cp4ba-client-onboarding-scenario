# Client Onboarding Scenario

## Introduction

The client onboarding scenario is an end-to-end solution that showcases the art of the possible with IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation (CP4BA). You can see the solution in action in this [pre-recorded video](http://ibm.biz/cp4ba-overview-video).

## Prerequisites

A CP4BA environment. You have the following options to access an environment:
- Use a [Jam-in-a-box](https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/jam-in-a-box-for-business-automation) environment: This is a starter deployment of Cloud Pak for Business Automation which lets you reserve your own cluster and deploy the Client Onboarding solution to it automatically. The latest deployment instructions are available [here](https://github.com/IBM/cp4ba-client-onboarding-scenario/blob/main/23.0.1/DeployingClientOnboarding2301.md)
- Create a new cluster on IBM Cloud Red Hat Managed OpenShift using the SWAT team's [rapid deployment scripts](https://github.com/IBM/cp4ba-rapid-deployment) (depending on availability of the required version).
- Use your existing enterprise cluster with the following patterns: foundation, decisions_ads, application, document_processing, workflow and content.

If you plan to not use the internal email server/client that can be deployed as part of the Client Onboarding scenario, you would need to create a Gmail account. For the credentials, you will need to create an [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) which you will need later in the instructions.

## Import Instructions

Instructions to import the Client Onboarding solution are available for the following CP4BA versions:

- [CP4BA v23.0.1](https://github.com/IBM/cp4ba-client-onboarding-scenario/blob/main/23.0.1/DeployingClientOnboarding2301.md)
- [CP4BA v22.0.2](https://github.com/IBM/cp4ba-client-onboarding-scenario/blob/main/22.0.2/DeployingClientOnboarding2202.md)

Once you have imported the Client Onboarding scenario successfully, you can perform the [IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation labs](https://github.com/IBM/cp4ba-labs).

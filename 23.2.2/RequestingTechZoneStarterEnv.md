# Requesting a CP4BA 23.0.2 Starter deployment from IBM TechZone

## Introduction

This document describes the steps required to request a CP4BA 23.0.2 Starter deployment environment, that is suitable to deploy the Client Onboarding scenario to.

## Reserving an IBM TechZone environment

Reserve a Business Automation environment from IBM TechZone. For that select the **CP4BA 23.0.x - Multi-Pattern Starter TechZone Deployer powered CP4BA 2023.x** tile from the [Pre-Installed Software](https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/tech-zone-certified-base-images/journey-pre-installed-software) tab.

> [!WARNING]
>
> Currently (May 2024) TechZone requires you to specify an 'Sales opportunity number' independent of the purpose. for this type of environment. Rules may change without notice. Unfortunately we have no control and influence on that.

Provide and select the required information. The selection you make for 'Purpose' determines if you need to specify a 'Sales Opportunity number' and the 'reservation policy' (how long the environment is available and how often it can be extended).

Once you have reserved an environment in IBM TechZone, it is first **Scheduled** for provisioning. After a while it moves into status **Provisioning**, and after about 2-3 hours it finally becomes **Ready**. You will receive an email when provisioning starts and a second email with the subject '**Reservation Ready on IBM Technology Zone**' when it completes. 

> [!WARNING]
>
> Ready in this case only means that OpenShift has been provisioned and that deploying Cloud Pak for Business Automation has been started but **not** that it is fully deployed yet. This may take another 4-5 hours to complete. 
> See below for how to check that CP4BA has been successfully deployed.

The final email contains a link '**View My Reservations**' to get to your reservations. Click on this link and click on the tile that represents your reservation.

Towards the top of the screen you will find the **link to the OpenShift console**, the **Username** (which is always **kubeadmin**) to log into the OpenShift console, and the unique **Password** for the environment.
